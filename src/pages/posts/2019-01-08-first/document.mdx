This template is designed with a JAMstack architecture. This means that the blog is statically rendered for the fastest possible load time, but once loaded, it turns into a single page app -- ensuring navigation is silky smooth.

It follows a convention-over-configuation philosophy. It should work out of the box with minimal effort for most people's needs, but can also be configured where required.

Finally, an effort has been made to prefer explicit code over concise code, and simplicity over complexity. Magic is avoided wherever possible, even if this means more code is required for the desired result.

- Excited to test this
